<h1> Richland Library Northeast Branch</h1>

<p>
You are at home, just finishing the clean-up from your latest canning adventure. You have an abundance of jars filled with pickled red onions and carrots. However, your jars are still warm, so you don't want to put them away, and your entire home smells of vinegar, so you decided to go for a drive.</p>

<p>You fall into a sort of highway hypnosis, and when you snap out of it, you find yourself in the parking lot of the Northeast Branch of the Richland Library.</p>

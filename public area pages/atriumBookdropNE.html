<h1>Book Drop Room</h1>

<p>
You walk in the front door only to find yourself in some sort of weird front door mini room with lots of windows. There is a book drop to your left, along with a small stool.</p>

<p>Looking around, you feel there should at least be a coat rack to make this space make sense, maybe even just an umbrella stand.</p>

<p>Before you can finish your thought, someone comes in the door behind you and asks you to move. The newcomer's bag of books is so large that it nocks into you as they try to get over to the book drop. You now see the need for just a little bit of extra space.</p>

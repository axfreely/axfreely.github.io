<h1> Adult Fiction  </h1>

<p>
The next shelf of books you see has a sign that says Adult Fiction. You are getting ready to walk off when you notice a thick book that catches your eye. On its cover is a girl's face with the "date" 1Q84 overlaid in different colors. Wanting to know more about it, you decided to read the summary on the inside cover. It reads:
</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.amazon.com/1Q84-Vintage-International-Haruki-Murakami/dp/0307476464" style="font-size:15px;" >

The year is 1984, and the city is Tokyo.
<br><br>
A young woman named Aomame follows a taxi driver's enigmatic suggestion and begins to notice puzzling discrepancies in the world around her. She has entered, she realizes, a parallel existence, which she calls 1Q84. Q is for question mark. A world that bears a question.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, an aspiring writer named Tengo takes on a suspect ghostwriting project. He becomes so wrapped up with the work and its unusual author that, soon, his previously placid life begins to come unraveled.
<br><br>
As Aomame's and Tengo's narratives converge over the course of this single year, we learn of the profound and tangled connections that bind them ever closer: a beautiful, dyslexic teenage girl with a unique vision; a mysterious religious cult that instigated a shoot-out with the metropolitan police; a reclusive, wealthy dowager who runs a shelter for abused women; a hideously ugly private investigator; a mild-mannered yet ruthlessly efficient bodyguard; and a peculiarly insistent television-fee collector.
<br><br>
A love story, a mystery, a fantasy, a novel of self-discovery, a dystopia to rival George Orwell's—1Q84 is Haruki Murakami's most ambitious undertaking yet: an instant bestseller in his native Japan, and a tremendous feat of imagination from one of our most revered contemporary writers.

<p>It's thick, but you are compelled to hang on to it. Intending to check it out after you finish looking around.</p>
